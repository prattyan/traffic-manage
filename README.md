## 🚀 System Workflow

1. **Video Input**  
   Captures real-time video from a camera or video file using OpenCV

2. **Vehicle Detection**  
   YOLOv8 detects cars, buses, bikes, and emergency vehicles

3. **Traffic Prediction**  
   LSTM model predicts congestion levels based on vehicle density

4. **Decision Engine**  
   Adjusts traffic signal timing dynamically and prioritizes emergency vehicles

5. **Live Dashboard**  
   Displays vehicle count and traffic decisions with periodic updates

## 📊 Public Traffic Datasets & Evaluation

To benchmark the detection and prediction models, we use standardized public datasets.

### Supported Datasets
1. **[UA-DETRAC](https://detrac-db.rit.albany.edu/)**: A challenging real-world multi-object detection and multi-object tracking benchmark.
2. **[BDD100K](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/)**: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning.
3. **[METR-LA / PEMS-BAY](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN)**: Traffic forecasting datasets containing traffic speed readings.

### Running the Evaluation Pipeline
We provide an evaluation script to calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, Correlation Matrix, and FPS.

```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset path/to/dataset
```
*Note: If no dataset is provided, the script will run a demonstration using synthetic data and the sample video to generate the required plots in the `evaluation_results/` directory.*
